## üõ†Ô∏è TODO

- **Remove Stripe Integration**: Replace Stripe with a default payment process in the cart to automatically update the order table. Currently, due to Stripe not being connected with GST, manual intervention is needed:
  - Use Postman to manually send a request.
  - Change `paymentDone` to `true` in MongoDB to see updates in the order pages.
  - This process needs to be automated to avoid manual adjustments.
